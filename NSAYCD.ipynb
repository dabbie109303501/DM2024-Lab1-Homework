Although we have many singers now, but, I can vouch for Jim Reeves all the time. You feel relaxed, emotional and loving. Thank you Lord for his life.\",\"The mist beautiful voice ever I listened to him when I was a kid and still love his singing Never forgotten The voice of an angel\",\"I have most of Mr. Reeves songs.  Always love his smooth voice, so comforting and sounds like the people I grew up around.  They were so gentle and sweet, but I had to leave my little town to find a job at age 17.  I graduated early.  I never forgot how great it was to grow up with simple people who had no pretensions -- just loving and gentle, like I think Jesus is.\",\"30 day leave from 1st tour in Viet Nam to convince my Mary Lou to \"marry me\" when I came back from my 2nd tour.  Now, 47 years later this December God granted the greatest blessing a man can receive.  This song is for the hope of life all who have served pray for and some are granted that hope to be reality. Thank you my Mary Lou.\",\"listening to his songs reminds me of my mum who played him everyday\",...,\"40 years before I LISTEN THIS SONG AND I STILL HAVE MY PAST MEMORY WHICH I REMEMBER WHILE  LISTEN  THIS.

Damn I feel like I have been reincarnated and my old life was a girl who likes these kinds of songs\",\"So beautiful !! Those backing vocals. Oh Sometimes I wish i was born in the 60s . Don't know why I enjoy these old songs\",\"Beautiful song reminds me of when I was young\",\"Honey running over butter  still cant describe the voice\"],[\"Every time you hear their song....you get a feeling of calmness...happiness and a smile comes on.\",\"I love this classic old faction songs! It brings my memory back to my childhood 40 years ago in China! Can you image that? In 1970s, China is still conservative country. These songs were band to be broadcasted. But beautiful songs were strong enough to break the iron firm rules and were heard from here and there in streets.  When my childhood was poor not able to afford a Carmen castes player, I already could sing these songs in 1970s. Love these songs! \",\"Funny, but so many generations an say this about the music of their youth, and it is true to them. Sad to think what today's auto-tuned listeners will have to look back on as the songs of their era, lest they say the listened to their parents', grandparents', and grandparents' music as their introduction to music in its truer form\",\"These days I really wish It could be yesterday. Today's world is way to painful an weird. This song still makes me cry. Sadly, we lost Karen 36 years ago today \",\"I'm glad I have this stuck in my head because I have to learn it for choir lol.\",...,\"i don't know!..but the opening of the video,..seeing him,..would suggest that!...he's got that Richard Simmons thing going on as well!...or that painter who speaks softly!\",\"it's sad this is such a beautiful song when you love someone and your afraid to tell him how you really feel..\",\"Dear Friend, I think age and time is not that important when it comes to music. I am glad you like this song.\",\"I was born in 1954 and started to be aware of popular music through my grandmother. This sound, even at the age of 4 or 5 years of age, captured my imagination. I still love it today and, as many others who have commented, there has never been anyone to emulate Elvis in his presentation, voice and presence. He really was gifted.\",\"This is the first CD I bought after my marriage ended in divorce after 28 years.
